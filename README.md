# Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease through MRI Analysis

This project leverages AI technologies to assist in the early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease by analyzing MRI brain scans. The system is built using advanced machine learning techniques and optimized for scalability, accuracy, and efficiency.

## Features

- **AI Model**: YOLOv11, fine-tuned for identifying Alzheimer’s biomarkers in MRI scans.
- **Stages Detected**: Negligible, Very Mild, Mild, and Moderate Dementia.
- **Performance**: Achieves 90% accuracy, with improved training efficiency through optimization.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable for diverse medical imaging tasks.
- **Real-time Processing**: Enables faster diagnosis and actionable clinical insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow/PyTorch (for YOLOv11 training)
- **Dataset**: [OASIS dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis)
- **Hardware**: RTX 3080 GPU (due to unavailability of Intel AI-powered hardware)

## Installation and Setup
